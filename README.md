# RAML Store


## Overview

raml-store provides a simple storage API plus a persistence plugin which enables you to run the RAML API Designer (https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer) locally (rather than use the APIHub cloud service) and still be able to manage and collaborate on your design.

### Requirements

The service is built with node.js, using express and mongodb.

***Installation Instructions coming soon***

### Integration with API-Designer
Follow instructions at https://github.com/mulesoft/api-designer to install and run API-Designer.  Where they reference embedding the designer, you can simply copy the sample-designer from this project into the api-designer app directory (https://github.com/brianmc/raml-store/blob/master/sample-designer.html).
